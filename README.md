This package implements reactive blockchain RPC calls using [cells](https://github.com/okcontract/cells).
Functional & Reactive programming (FRP) simplifies handling complex, dynamic
data flows: It is particularly useful in scenarios with asynchronous data
sources, such as user interfaces or real-time data feeds.
`cells` is a simplified Functional & Reactive (but not strictly FRP) library
inspired by spreadsheets.


## Walkthrough

```typescript
import { Sheet } from "@okcontract/cells";
import {} from "@okcontract/multichain";
```
